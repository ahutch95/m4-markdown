# Exercise-1

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

Listen to the MUSTN'TS, child,
      Listen to the DON'TS
      Listen to the SHOULDN'TS
The IMPOSSIBLES, the WONT'S
      Listen to the NEVER HAVES
Then listen close to me-
      Anything can happen, child,
ANYTHING can be
